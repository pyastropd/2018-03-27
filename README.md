# Machine learning for images and more: Keras and Tensorflow

by *Mario Pasquato*

I will present Keras. Keras is an easier way to use TensorFlow.

TensorFlow is used to build and train neural networks. Keras is more user friendly.

Basically we throw a numpy array with data in, and get a numpy array with predictions out.

-----

## You will need to install tensorflow and keras
This should work:
```bash
sudo pip install tensorflow
sudo pip install keras
```
if not, have a look at [the installation instructions over here](https://keras.io).


## Why Keras?
* You want to build deep learning models (fancy name for neural networks with hidden layers)
* You use Python (2.7 and later versions will work)
* You don't want to learn [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* You still want to use TensorFlow through Keras
